- **Student Management:** Add, retrieve, update, and delete student records. Supports batch operations for adding and deleting students.
- **Teacher Management:** Add, retrieve, update, and delete teacher records. Supports batch operations for adding and deleting teachers.
- **Relationships:** Retrieve students associated with a specific teacher and get the count of students for a teacher.
- **Authentication:** JWT-based authentication for securing executive user access.

## Technologies

- **Go:** v1.23.2
- **Database:** MySQL
- **Routing:** `net/http` (standard Go library)
- **Go Modules:**
  - `github.com/go-sql-driver/mysql`: For MySQL database interaction.
  - `github.com/joho/godotenv`: For loading environment variables from a `.env` file.
  - `github.com/golang-jwt/jwt/v5`: For JSON Web Token (JWT) generation and verification.

## Installation

1.  **Ensure Go is Installed:** If you don't have Go installed on your system, please follow the installation guide at https://go.dev/doc/install.

2.  **Clone the Repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone <your-repository-url>
    cd "Academic Management System"
    ```

3.  **Download Dependencies:**

    ```bash
    go mod tidy
    ```

    This command will download all the necessary Go packages listed in the `go.mod` file.

4.  **Create the `.env` File:**
    In the root directory of the project, create a file named `.env` and copy the following content into it. This file contains the environment variables required for the API to connect to the database and configure other settings.

    ```env
    DB_USER=root
    DB_PASSWORD=root
    DB_NAME=school
    API_PORT=:3000
    DB_PORT=3306
    HOST=127.0.0.1
    CONNECTION_STRING=root:@tcp(127.0.0.1:3306)/school
    JWT_SECRET="jwtsecretstring"
    JWT_EXPIRES_IN=20m
    RESET_TOKEN_EXP_DURATION=10
    ```

    **Note:** You can modify these values according to your local database setup and desired API configuration.

## Running the API

1.  **Navigate to the API Directory:**

    ```bash
    cd "Academic Management System/cmd/api"
    ```

2.  **Run the API:**

    ```bash
    go run server.go
    ```

    This command will start the Academic Management System API server on the port specified in your `.env` file (default is `:3000`).
